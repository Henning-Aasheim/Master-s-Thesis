\begin{abstract}
    Democratic backsliding is continuing unabated and the debates around its causes are far from being concluded. While domestic factors have received by far the most attention, a new strain of research is concerned with international factors. One theory argues that ideas, norms, policies, and procedures can all spread from country to country by way of linkages. However, there has so far been a dearth of quantitative studies focusing on this phenomenon. An additional problem is that up to now, they have mostly dealt with measures of democracy that are highly aggregated. This aggregated data might obscure the effect of linkages as they can have both negative and positive effects on democracy. I try to account for this by looking at the impact of linkages on freedom of expression: the component of democracy that has had the most rapid decline in the last decade. I study this phenomenon by looking at the most powerful autocracy of the last 30 years -- China -- to have the best chance of uncovering a relationship between linkages to a major authoritarian country and freedom of expression. To be more specific, I ask the question: \textit{to what extent do linkages to China affect freedom of expression?} Using a conservative fixed effects model, I find no evidence that linkages to China in general influences freedom of expression. This holds for several specifications.

    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}
I want to take the time to thank everyone who has helped me make this thesis possible. Without your help and support, the thesis would never have become as good as it became, and this is not something I could ever have hoped to achieve on my own.

I want to start by thanking my supervisors Ina Lyftingsmo Kristiansen and Felix Haas. I am indebted to your knowledge and patience. Without your feedback and guidance, this thesis would not have been worthy of submission. I cannot thank you enough for helping me even though I keep changing parts of the thesis at the last moment; and not always for the better. At those times, it has been invaluable to get a critical second-opinion on my work.

I would also like to thank Jørgen Bølstad for input on statistical significance. The thesis is not perfect, but it would have been significantly worse without your guidance.

I want to thank my fellow student Oliver Mydske for taking the time to review my thesis and pointing out mistake after mistake. Without your discerning eye, the language and content of the thesis would be of much lower quality. 

Finally, I want to thank family and friends for taking an interest in what I am writing and supporting me through the process. It has been a useful exercise to try to explain what I am writing about to people not living in the world of political science. We all benefit from an outsider's perspective ever and anon.
