	abstract = {Growing racial, ideological, and cultural polarization within the American electorate contributed to the shocking victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Using data from American National Election Studies surveys, we show that Trump’s unusually explicit appeals to racial and ethnic resentment attracted strong support from white working-class voters while repelling many college-educated whites along with the overwhelming majority of nonwhite voters. However, Trump’s campaign exploited divisions that have been growing within the electorate for decades because of demographic and cultural changes in American society. The 2016 presidential campaign also reinforced another longstanding trend in American electoral politics: the rise of negative partisanship, that is voting based on hostility toward the opposing party and its leaders. We conclude with a discussion of the consequences of deepening partisan and affective polarization for American democracy and the perceptions by both experts and the public of an erosion in its quality.},

	abstract = {What explains the backlash against the liberal international order? Are its causes economic or cultural? We argue that while cultural values are central to understanding the backlash, those values are, in part, endogenous and shaped by long-run economic change. Using an original survey of the British population, we show that individuals living in regions where the local labor market was more substantially affected by imports from China have significantly more authoritarian values and that this relationship is driven by the effect of economic change on authoritarian aggression. This result is consistent with a frustration-aggression mechanism by which large economic shocks hinder individuals’ expected attainment of their goals. This study provides a theoretical mechanism that helps to account for the opinions and behaviors of Leave voters in the 2016 UK referendum who in seeking the authoritarian values of order and conformity desired to reduce immigration and “take back control” of policymaking.},

One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments, conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion. Although partisans might acknowledge the same facts, they are apt in seizing on and producing attributional arguments that fit their preferred worldviews.},

Despite heated debates about the political repercussions of the refugee crisis in Europe, there exists very little—and sometimes conflicting—evidence with which to assess the impact of a large influx of refugees on natives’ political attitudes and behavior. We provide causal evidence from a natural experiment in Greece, where some Aegean islands close to the Turkish border experienced sudden and drastic increases in the number of Syrian refugees while other islands slightly farther away—but with otherwise similar institutional and socioeconomic characteristics—did not. Placebo tests suggest that precrisis trends in vote shares for exposed and nonexposed islands were virtually identical. This allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of the electoral consequences of the refugee crisis. Our study shows that among islands that faced a massive but transient inflow of refugees passing through just before the September 2015 election, vote shares for Golden Dawn, the most extreme-right party in Europe, moderately increased by 2 percentage points (a 44 percent increase at the average). The finding that mere exposure to the refugee crisis is sufficient to fuel support for extreme-right parties has important implications for our theoretical understanding of the drivers of antirefugee backlash.},

Across a wide sample of countries in North America and Western Europe, citizens of mature democracies have become markedly less satisfied with their form of government and surprisingly open to nondemocratic alternatives.

Our research design allows us to infer Americans’ willingness to trade-off democratic principles for other valid but potentially conflicting considerations such as political ideology, partisan loyalty, and policy preferences. We find the U.S. public’s viability as a democratic check to be strikingly limited: only a small fraction of Americans prioritize democratic principles in their electoral choices, and their tendency to do so is decreasing in several measures of polarization, including the strength of partisanship, policy extremism, and candidate platform divergence. Our findings echo classic arguments about the importance of political moderation and cross-cutting cleavages for democratic stability and highlight the dangers that polarization represents for democracy.},

Gradual declines of democratic regime attributes characterize contemporary autocratization. Yet, we lack the appropriate conceptual and empirical tools to diagnose and compare such elusive processes. Addressing that gap, this article provides the first comprehensive empirical overview of all autocratization episodes from 1900 to today based on data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem). We demonstrate that a third wave of autocratization is indeed unfolding. It mainly affects democracies with gradual setbacks under a legal façade. While this is a cause for concern, the historical perspective presented in this article shows that panic is not warranted: the current declines are relatively mild and the global share of democratic countries remains close to its all-time high. As it was premature to announce the “end of history” in 1992, it is premature to proclaim the “end of democracy” now.},

First, it conflates the significance of economic insecurity in influencing the election outcome on the margin with its significance in explaining the overall populist vote. Empirical findings indicate that the share of populist support explained by economic insecurity is modest. Second, recent evidence indicates that voters' concern with immigration—a key issue for many populist parties—is only marginally shaped by its real or perceived repercussions on their economic standing. Third, economics-centric accounts of populism treat voters' cultural concerns as largely a by-product of experiencing adverse economic change. This approach underplays the reverse process, whereby disaffection from social and cultural change drives both economic discontent and support for populism.},

	abstract = {Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and preferences for the information sources from which to obtain them, represent genuine differences of opinion or insincere cheerleading? The answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow respondents to search for information before answering each question. We find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information, but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in information search; these divides are no different from those that occur outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their party in a favorable light.},

The authors offer a distinct explanation of the rise of authoritarian populism in advanced democracies. As societies become more liberal over time, older, more conservative cohorts feel under threat of losing majority status and allegedly turn towards authoritarian-populist parties that promise to stop the tide of liberalism. However, this theory of populism finds little empirical support. In contrast to what the authors argue, there is no polarization of attitudes between younger and older cohorts, and younger cohorts are more likely to vote for authoritarian-populist parties. To substantiate this claim, I replicate many of the analyses in Cultural Backlash and add additional ones with the newest wave of the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. I conclude by observing that while the cultural backlash theory of populism does not hold, this does not invalidate cultural approaches more generally.},

Using both novel precinct- and individual-level data from Denmark, we show that negative shocks to house prices over the election cycle are strongly associated with shifts to support for the Danish People’s Party, a pattern that has amplified over recent elections.

An ostensibly unrelated survey found that voters often adopted the positions legislators took, even when legislators offered little justification. Moreover, voters did not evaluate their legislators more negatively when representatives took positions these voters had previously opposed, again regardless of whether legislators provided justifications.

Existing literature demonstrates that citizens generally choose the latter—and that they do so deliberately. Yet there is an alternative possibility. Citizens can avoid this uncomfortable dilemma altogether by rationalizing their understandings of democracy. When a politician advances undesired policies without violating democratic rules and norms, people find ways to perceive the behavior as undemocratic. When a politician acts undemocratically to promote desired policies, citizens muster up arguments for considering it democratic. Original survey experiments in the United States, and 22 democracies worldwide, provide strong support for this argument. It is thus not deliberate acceptance, but a fundamentally different perceptual logic that drives the widespread approval of undemocratic behavior in today’s democracies.},

These results hold throughout the democratic world, and more consolidated democracies are less likely to have a high percentage of rationalisers, while less consolidated ones have a higher proportion of rationalisers.

Building on recent debates about the heterogeneity of democratic attitudes among citizens, we probe how divergent understandings of democracy may shape citizens' ability to recognize democratic violations as such and, in turn, affect vote choice. We leverage a novel approach to estimate the behavioral consequences of such individual-level understandings of democracy by means of a candidate choice conjoint experiment in Poland, a country experiencing democratic backsliding in a context of deep polarization. We find support for our claim that respondents who adhere less strongly to liberal democratic norms tolerate democratic violations more readily. Conversely, voters who subscribe more strongly to a liberal understanding are more likely to punish non-liberal candidates, including co-partisan ones. Thus, we contend that a lack of attitudinal consolidation around liberal democracy explains continued voter support for authoritarian-leaning leaders.},

However, because recent democratic decline is concentrated in democracies, the objective indicators can accurately test for backsliding only if they can track democratic quality within democracies. This response article shows that they cannot, for conceptual and empirical reasons. The indicators generally can distinguish democracies from autocracies but are blind to variation in quality within democracies. L\&M, therefore, are showing that one form of variation in democracy is stagnant but are systematically missing the very type of variation that has most informed current warnings about backsliding.},

Second, exposure was concentrated among users who strongly identified as Republicans. Third, exposure to the Russian influence campaign was eclipsed by content from domestic news media and politicians.

Causal inference encompasses the tools that allow social scientists to determine what causes what. Economists-who generally can't run controlled experiments to test and validate their hypotheses-apply these tools to observational data to make connections. In a messy world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and
effects of the actions being studied, whether the impact (or lack thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the
effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in
life, or the introduction of malaria nets in developing regions on economic growth. Scott Cunningham introduces students and
practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful
answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling
techniques and coding instructions for both the R and Stata
programming languages.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses. Features Integrates working code into the main text Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

	abstract = {As the color revolutions have stalled and the challenge to democracy by authoritarianism has increased, it is essential to explore the potential of a new "reverse wave" which may create a greater balance between liberalism and autocracy. This article seeks to begin this process by outlining a framework of authoritarian diffusion. Two key diffusion dynamics are outlined: appropriateness, the impact of changes in the relative normative power of democracy/autocracy, and effectiveness, how the successes of authoritarian countries increase the chances that others will see them as role models. A number of contributing factors are also identified, which make these processes more or less likely. These include: geography, linkage, international organizations, great power prestige, and reference groups. If we are to understand the future strength of authoritarianism as a global or regional phenomenon, which affects, reinforces, and aggravates domestic conditions, then a new theoretical framework is necessary.},

	abstract = {China's rise is often interpreted as a harbinger of a new era in world politics and raises the question if such a power transition may impact upon patterns of democratic rule across the globe. There is growing interest in whether China acts as an outside stabilizer for other authoritarian regimes. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the international dimension of autocratic rule by focusing on Chinese Latin American policy. Using the method of structured focused comparisons, we want to assess whether China's relations towards the Latin American autocracies Cuba and Venezuela differ from those with structurally similar, but democratic cooperation partners in the region, namely Costa Rica and Chile. The guiding question is whether we can detect such a pattern of specific bilateral relationships between China and other autocracies, leading to an 'authoritarian nexus' in Chinese foreign policy. El ascenso de China se suele interpretar como un presagio de una nueva era en la política mundial y plantea la cuestión de si dicha transición de poder podría repercutir en los patrones de la democracia en el mundo entero. La cuestión de si China actúa como estabilizador externo para otros regímenes autoritarios suscita cada vez más interés. Este artículo es una contribución a la bibliografía emergente sobre la dimensión internacional de los sistemas autocráticos enfocándose en la política chino-latinoamericana. Mediante el método de las comparaciones estructuradas y focalizadas, queremos evaluar si las relaciones de China con las autocracias latinoamericanas de Cuba y Venezuela difieren de las relaciones con otros aliados estructuralmente similares, pero democráticos en la región, como Costa Rica y Chile. La pregunta clave es si podemos detectar este patrón de relaciones bilaterales específicas entre China y otras autocracias, un patrón que desemboque en un 'nexo autoritario' en la política exterior china.},

I review three recent books that represent this trend to varying degrees. Based on a historical-institutional approach, I assess whether the theoretical propositions of these books are fruitful for explaining the gradual backsliding to competitive authoritarianism and illiberalism in recent decades. I find that the propositions in How Democracies Die in particular risk leading to excessively voluntarist conclusions that are insensitive to historical path dependencies. The other two books better capture the ways in which domestic institutional legacies have shaped democratic backsliding around the globe. I end the review by specifying two models that explain backslidings as institutional responses to 1) international "exogenous" shocks or 2) "endogenous" demands unleashed by dynamics of the democratic transition itself. I show that these two models provide a more comprehensive understanding of a diverse set of the most infamous recent backslidings in the United States, Venezuela, Hungary, and Turkey.},

This article argues that state power is the most powerful weapon in the authoritarian arsenal. After clarifying the regime-state distinction and explaining why regime durability involves more than just duration, we discuss four "infrastructural mechanisms" through which authoritarian regimes stabilize and sustain their rule: (1) coercing rivals, (2) extracting revenues, (3) registering citizens and (4) cultivating dependence. Since state apparatuses are the institutions best geared for performing these tasks, their effectiveness underpins authoritarian durability in a way that no other institution can duplicate. And since state power is shaped by long-term historical forces, future studies should adopt the kind of historical perspective more often seen in leading studies of postcolonial economic development than of authoritarian durability.},

Using interview data from security personnel in China, this study expands current conceptualizations of authoritarian durability and coercive capacity to consider a wide range of security activities.

Considering security activities beyond protest control exposes cracks in China’s authoritarian system of control—an area where it is typically perceived to thrive—and calls into question our understanding of regime resilience as well as our current approach to assessing the role coercive capacity plays in authoritarian resilience elsewhere.},

This article proposes methods for incorporating a priori notions about social structure into analysis. Diffusion is modeled within an event history framework where the individual's rate of adoption is a function of prior adoptions by related actors. Two diffusion models are suggested: an epidemic model where adoption rates vary with the number of prior adoptions, and a salience model where adoption rates vary with time since the last event. This approach is illustrated in an examination of the decolonization of British and French colonies. Diffusion is shown to occur within regions rather than within empires or the world system as a whole.},

	abstract = {What are the consequences for democracy when an autocratic state expands its global influence? Recent literature investigating trends of autocratisation has argued that authoritarian norms and ideas can spread between states through a process known as autocratic diffusion, but so far a quantitative study investigating the strength of this argument has been lacking. In this thesis, I seek to fill this gap by investigating one autocracy - China - and how its ascent as a major economic and political actor in the past 30 years has impacted democratic development in other states. More specifically, I am interested in whether stronger network ties to China will cause other states to become more autocratic. I break these ties down into three components - economic, elite, and organisational ties - and create a framework explaining how these ties are associated with autocratisation. I then use OLS regression with first differences to investigate whether changes over time in these variables are associated with future autocratisation. The results provide support for elite and organisational ties being negatively associated with democratic development, lending credibility to the theory of autocratic diffusion. I further argue based on my theory and research design that this relationship is causal and suggest that future research should investigate these mechanisms more thoroughly.},

Autocracies that are guided by a dynamic, missionary ideology, such as interwar fascism and, less fervently, the Bolivarianism of Hugo Chávez, actively promote their new credo in a wide range of countries. Moreover, these messianic belief systems stimulate diffusion processes across the globe. A wide range of political leaders take inspiration from these missionary ideologies and emulate their values and ideas to a greater or lesser extent. By contrast, most authoritarian regimes in the contemporary era lack an expansive ideology and are driven mostly by political interests. International diffusion and cooperation among these regimes reflects mainly the defensive goal of immunization against Western efforts at democracy promotion. To guarantee regime survival, authoritarian great powers in the post-Cold War world, such as Russia and China, concentrate on fortifying their regional sphere of influence. Thus, targeted, calculated collaboration and instrumental learning prevail.},

The dynamics of the interaction between external democratic and autocratic diffusion processes and their effects on national and sub-national political regime outcomes have received scant attention in the literature. Do democratic diffusion processes help counter external authoritarian influences? And, in contexts where external diffusion of democratic influences is weak, do we observe greater susceptibility to diffusion from regional autocracies that might in turn reinforce authoritarian practices and institutions in “recipient” states? To address these questions, we perform analysis of data from two original under-utilized data sets—a data set on the European Union (EU) aid to Russia’s regions and a data set with statistics on trade among post-Soviet states. We find that EU aid has the effect of countering external authoritarian influences that work through Soviet-era inter-regional economic ties.},

Autocratization is the decline of democratic regime attributes and occurs in both democracies and autocracies. In this thesis, I bring together theories from the two literatures on democratic and autocratic diffusion. Using these theories as a foundation, I create a framework based on geographic linkages to explore global patterns of autocratic diffusion over the past century. The analysis is based on data from the V-Dem Institute and the Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy, covering 183 countries from 1900-2020. Using a two-way fixed effects model, I find that, in a given country, both proximity to democratic breakdowns and proximity to autocratizing countries correlate with autocratization. My thesis contributes to bringing the increasingly heterogeneous literature on diffusion back to basics by examining the ability of the existing theory of democratic diffusion to explain global patterns of autocratic diffusion. My results corroborate findings in the democratic diffusion literature, namely that countries become more similar to their neighbors. To account for the difficulties in capturing the nuanced mechanisms of diffusion, my findings propose that future research should build on the finding of this thesis and conduct small-N studies to tease out individual mechanisms at play.},

Consequently, there is increasing interest in and concerns about the diffusion of alternative ‘models’ of political and economic development. Given that China's impressive economic development has led to growing military strength and geopolitical prestige, evaluating perceptions of the legitimacy, effectiveness, and applicability of that country's model of ‘illiberal capitalism’ is a good place to start. This paper evaluates whether the ‘China Model’ or ‘Beijing Consensus' is gaining traction internationally through a content analysis of eight years of US and non-US media sources. It finds that concerns about the beginnings of an anti-democratic ‘reverse wave’ are exaggerated and that at the present time there does not appear to be a decisive shift in favour of a model of authoritarian-capitalism.},

We argue that Western powers are not unequivocally committed to the promotion of democracy and human rights, while non-democratic regional powers cannot simply be described as “autocracy supporters”. This article introduces the special issue. First, illiberal regional powers are likely to respond to Western efforts at democracy promotion in third countries if they perceive challenges to their geostrategic interests in the region or to the survival of their regime. Second, Western democracy promoters react to countervailing policies by illiberal regimes if they prioritize democracy and human rights goals over stability and security goals which depends in turn on their perception of the situation in the target countries and their overall relationships to the non-democratic regional powers. Third, the effects on the ground mostly depend on the domestic configuration of forces. Western democracy promoters are likely to empower liberal groups in the target countries, while countervailing efforts by non-democratic regional powers will empower illiberal groups. In some cases, though, countervailing efforts by illiberal regimes have the counterintuitive effect of fostering democracy by strengthening democratic elites and civil society.},

Third, we discuss the contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality and validity by devoting greater attention to context.

In addition to withholding democratic rights of one-fifth of the world's population, authoritarian China represents an alternative development model that has gained significant traction. China thus constitutes a challenge to democracy promoters. But does Beijing also countervail democracy promotion by the European Union and the United States? After a summary of the party-state's response to democracy promotion at home, we test the hypothesis that geostrategic interests or a perceived risk of regime survival will lead the People's Republic to countervail democracy promotion outside its own borders. We do so by focusing on the most likely cases in China's near-abroad: Myanmar and Hong Kong. Our analysis of Myanmar suggests that Beijing remains focused on securing economic and security interests irrespective of regime type when regime survival at home is not at risk. The case of Hong Kong, on the other hand, allows us to identify the tactics used by Beijing when there is a significant risk of democratic spillover. This case also demonstrates that the People's Republic of China is able to stifle United States and European Union democracy support when it wishes to do so.},

In this article, we engage recent works to examine this question in relation to how Australians perceive the political example offered by China and Singapore.

Extensive linkage contributes to democratization even under unfavorable domestic conditions.

Where linkage is low but leverage high, external pressure is intermittent and partially effective. Slovakia, Mexico, Russia, and Zambia are examined.},

The post-cold-war international environment, in this framework, operates along two dimensions: western leverage, or the degree to which governments are vulnerable to external democratizing pressure, and linkage to the West, or the density of ties (economic, political, diplomatic, social, and organization al) and cross-border flows (of trade and investment, people, and communication) between particular countries and the United States, the European Union (EU), and western-led multilateral institutions.3 Leverage in the absence of linkage has rarely been sufficient to induce democratization since the end of the cold war. Although external pressure at times succeeded in forcing elections or blocking authoritarian regressions, the more diffuse effects of linkage have contributed more consistently to democratization. Linkage has raised the cost of autocratic abuses by increasing their international salience and the likelihood of external response, enhancing the power and prestige of opposition forces, and expanding the number of domestic actors with a political, economic, or professional stake in adhering to international norms” (Levitsky and Way, 2006, p. 379)

The main question is whether the observed close relation between levels of economic development and the incidence of democratic regimes is due to democracies being more likely to emerge or only more likely to survive in the more developed countries. We answer this question using data concerning 135 countries that existed at any time between 1950 and 1990. We find that the level of economic development does not affect the probability of transitions to democracy but that affluence does make democratic regimes more stable. The relation between affluence and democratic stability is monotonic, and the breakdown of democracies at middle levels of development is a phenomenon peculiar to the Southern Cone of Latin America. These patterns also appear to have been true of the earlier period, but dictatorships are more likely to survive in wealthy countries that became independent only after 1950. We conclude that modernization need not generate democracy but democracies survive in countries that are modern.},

The theory doesn’t state that a society will automatically become democratic when it modernises, only that it will become more likely to democratise, and that this is a contingent procedure.

	abstract = {This article examines coercive capacity and its impact on autocratic regime stability in the context of post-Soviet Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine. In the post-Cold War era, different types of coercive acts require different types of state power. First, high intensity and risky measures – such as firing on large crowds or stealing elections – necessitate high degrees of cohesion or compliance within the state apparatus. Second, effective low intensity measures – including the surveillance and infiltration of opposition, and various forms of less visible police harassment – require extensive state scope or a well-trained state apparatus that penetrates large parts of society. Coercive state capacity, rooted in cohesion and scope, has often been more important than opposition strength in determining whether autocrats fall or remain in power. Thus, the regime in Armenia that was backed by a highly cohesive state with extensive scope was able to maintain power in the face of highly mobilized opposition challenges. By contrast, regimes in Georgia where the state lacked cohesion and scope fell in the face of even weakly mobilized opposition. Relatively high scope but only moderate cohesion in Belarus and Ukraine has made autocratic regimes in these countries generally more effective at low intensity coercion to prevent the emergence of opposition than at high intensity coercion necessary to face down serious opposition challenges.},

This article investigates Ethiopia and Angola as two cases where one would expect that the growing presence of China has made it more difficult for the EU and US to support reforms. Empirical findings presented in this article go against this argument. In both countries, the EU and the US face substantial difficulties to make the respective government address governance issues. However, the presence of China has not made it more difficult for the US and the EU to implement their strategies. Instead the empirical analysis suggests that domestic factors in Ethiopia and Angola, notably the level of challenge to regime survival both governments face, influence both governments’ willingness to engage with the EU and US.},

They have also underlined a broader problem: that of how illiberal powers may react to democracy promotion, especially when their strategic interests are at stake. This article investigates these issues by studying Russia's interactions with the countries in its neighbourhood and democracy promoters. First, the article argues that even if Russia has contributed to the stagnation of democratization and ineffectiveness of democracy promotion in its neighbourhood, its actions do not constitute autocracy promotion and largely lack ideological underpinnings. Second, Russia's counteraction to democracy promotion stems from its ambitions of restoring its great power status, maintaining its regional influence, and perceiving Western policies as a threat to its interests. Third, when it considers its strategic interests undermined, Russia employs economic and military threats (sometimes incentives) against its neighbourhood countries to make the compliance with Western policies less preferable.},

It is also argued that it can prevent spillover.
“Russia’s problem with the democratization of its near abroad has not been in the establishment of democracy, it has rather been in the possible westernization of these countries as a result of democratization and their possible turn from their forced allegiance to Russia, as happened in the case of the Baltic States.” (Babayan, 2015, p. 443)
Another point this contribution makes is that authoritarian countries can spread autocracy by using tactics of aggression to reduce state capacity. This is not direct autocratisation, but is a pressure that weakens democratisation.

We argue that despite the relatively weak impact of EU and US policies vis-à-vis domestic structures, Russia has responded harshly to (what it perceives as) a Western expansionist agenda in pursuit of reasserting its own hegemonic position in the post-Soviet space. However, coercive pressure from Russia has also unintended, counterproductive effects.

The article highlights how the transatlantic democracy promotion strategy is complicated by a conflict of interests problem, which leads them to promote democracy on an ad hoc and incremental basis. As a result, their efforts and larger strategic thinking are undermined by Saudi Arabia in Egypt. However, in Bahrain, transatlantic democracy promotion is itself muted by the strategic interest in containing Iran. As a result, Saudi Arabia can be seen as a regional countervailing power but this is implicitly in line with transatlantic policy. Tensions with Saudi foreign policy in Bahrain are over how best to manage the uprisings and maintain the status quo, rather than a conflict over political transition.},

In the case of Tunisia, Saudi Arabia is discredited, the EU offers tangible and credible support and there are few operational veto-players. This makes external democracy promotion possible, by way of altering the cost-benefit perceptions of the elites.

Even though Chávez promoted his script for regime change across Latin America and the Caribbean, his model was emulated only when opportunities opened up in nations such as Bolivia and Ecuador that experienced crises of political parties and the institutional framework of democracy. Bolivarianism was not emulated in nations where political parties and democratic institutions remained functioning, and where the left and civil society valued democracy, pluralism, and liberal rights due to brutal autocratic experiences. Despite its democratizing promises Bolivarianism did not lead to the radicalization of democracy but to its erosion and its displacement towards authoritarianism. The fear of Bolivarianism also led to a coup against president Zelaya in Honduras. Bolivarian strategies of populist rupture crossed the Atlantic and were adapted by PODEMOS that became the third largest political party in Spain.},

A few months later, the Saudi Kingdom followed suit and attempted to build a regional coalition to counter this constructed enemy. Although the Saudi Kingdom, acting as an aspiring regional autocratic power, exerted pressure to compel other regimes to follow its lead, the recipient states varied in their willingness to converge. Whereas the United Arab Emirates followed the Saudi lead, Jordan, Kuwait, and Bahrain resisted the diffusion of repression against the Muslim Brotherhood to their domestic spheres. This article examines this variation in the (non-)convergence of repressive policies as an outcome of diffusion. While most explanations of how autocratic policies diffuse focus on either ideology or interest as drivers of state behaviour, this article provides a nuanced understanding of this phenomenon. Based on a neoclassical realist approach, I explore the variation in the convergence with fellow autocrats as the result of interaction between regional interests and regime autonomy vis-à-vis societal groups. By looking at autocratic diffusion of repression as a process lying at the intersection of regional and domestic spheres, this article contributes to the literature on the international diffusion of authoritarianism.},

These processes came to be viewed as a rare case of authoritarian diffusion taking place towards an EU member state. Based on the discussion of interest versus ideational appeal as factors of authoritarian diffusion, the article develops a relational and dynamic framework to analyse the question of authoritarian diffusion. The framework underlines the importance not only of “sender state” attributes, but also those of receiver states. The analysis finds no empirical evidence for authoritarian diffusion; Hungary’s slide into illiberalism was not inspired or supported by Vladimir Putin. Instead, mutual interests are sufficient to understand Russo-Hungarian cooperation.},

Proponents of an “authoritarian resurgence” have speculated that China and Russia are rolling back democracy around the world, much like fascist powers in the interwar period. By contrast, the introductory article of this special issue theorizes that current authoritarian powers are not catalyzing autocracy far afield. Rather, they are prudentially defending the surrounding political order. The present article applies this framework to make sense of cross-national trends in democracy and authoritarianism. The bulk of evidence supports the notion that authoritarian powers have regionally shored up existing regimes, rather than globally subverting democracy. Evidence from around the world indicates the number of electoral democracies has been growing, democracy has remained tenuous in lower-income countries, and democratic breakdowns have owed more to unfavourable local conditions than predacious external actors.},

It highlights the primacy of pragmatic interests in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, a finding that holds in diverse cases in Eastern Central Europe, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. Of particular importance here are negative findings that reflect the absence of ideological appeal. At the same time, the primacy of interest-based accounts needs to be qualified, both today (Bolivarianism in Latin America) and especially considering a longer historical perspective. As the experiences of fascism and communism suggest, there used to be autocracies with missionary ideologies that inspired emulation in a wide range of countries. Against this background, the article advocates a “moving back” to history to better account for the context-bound nature of authoritarian diffusion and cooperation. It also calls for a “moving down” the ladder of abstraction to study the more concrete mechanisms in which authoritarian diffusion and cooperation unfold.},

This research develops the conceptualization of deepening autocratization, as the definition of autocratization should include deepening autocratization in already authoritarian countries, rather than focusing solely on regime change. It looks at elite-level dynamics in authoritarian regimes and discusses power concentration, including proposed measures for personalization, administrative centralization, and state control over economic assets. Understanding how deepening autocratization is linked with authoritarian resilience is also crucial, as there is no “one model fits all” solution for understanding authoritarian resilience in different types of authoritarian regimes. To improve the research agenda on authoritarian resilience, research should focus on the combination of causes and their interactions rather than effects of individual causes.},

I argue that the Chinese government occasionally promotes censorship in foreign countries, because it wishes to reduce negative media coverage of China or to silence certain groups abroad (e.g. Falun Gong). More often, China’s relative apathy about speech and press freedoms in foreign countries facilitates censorship in countries that can rely on trade with Beijing. Countries that cannot rely on China are less willing to risk alienating Western powers by violating press freedoms at home. Regime type is an important determinant as to whether censorship is facilitated through intensive economic integration with China, as democracies may respond to China’s rise differently than authoritarian countries. Analysis of country-level panel data shows higher rates of media censorship in democratic countries that trade intensively with China.},

“The results suggest that trading intensively with China leads to higher rates of censorship in democracies but has little effect on authoritarian countries. This result likely reflects the high levels of censorship that already characterize authoritarian countries, such that facilitation by China or a diffusion of its norms or censorship-enabling technologies have little additional effect. In contrast, democratic countries that tend to censor less frequently increase their suppression of the media in response to facilitation by China. This is consistent with earlier research suggesting that democratic leaders censor the media when doing so is facilitated politically” (Gamso, 2021, page 867-868)
*Important aside: the start of the analysis is set to 2002, which was the year that china acceded to the WTO, as China’s trade relations expanded greatly after this. 
*Imports from China don’t seem to be as important as exports to China for seeing the effect on censorship.
*It seems like autocracies decrease censorship when trading with the US, however this doesn’t cross the .5 threshold, however it is a tantalising find.

With the rise of China on the international stage, the spread of undemocratic norms, values and standards of behavior possibly associated with its increasing ties with many states around the world has specifically emerged as an area of concern. For Canada, a country having incorporated democracy-promotion into its foreign policy strategy, assessing the magnitude of such risk is a necessary step towards eventual policy adjustments aimed at countering autocratic influences abroad. In this article, we investigate the extent to which economic, political and security linkages with China contribute to the prevalence of media self-censorship, a behavior which has been associated with democratic backsliding in transitional regimes. We find a positive, significant and robust positive correlation between these variables. Strategic behavior by the China, actions by leaders of transitional regimes seeking to consolidate their rule, and the passive diffusion of norms, values and standards of behavior are proposed as likely mechanisms for the observed link. Our results suggest the significant power of economic, political and security linkages in affecting trajectories of democratization in countries around the world.},

For any given state, a dependence network is a set of partner states with whom it regularly engages in exchanges of valued goods, where those exchanges would be costly to break. We find that an index of three such networks–trade, security and shared international organization membership–significantly influences the domestic political institutions in a given state. These changes are substantively large in the long run, similar in size to regional and global levels of democracy. State capabilities figure heavily in our network measures, thus emphasizing the role of power in the diffusion of domestic political institutions. We also find that network-influenced change works both ways: states can become more autocratic or more democratic.},

On the one hand, they seek to increase analytic differentiation in order to capture the diverse forms of democracy that have emerged. On the other hand, they are concerned with conceptual validity. Specifically, they seek to avoid the problem of conceptual stretching that arises when the concept of democracy is applied to cases for which, by relevant scholarly standards, it is not appropriate. This article argues that the pursuit of these two goals has led to a proliferation of conceptual innovations, including numerous subtypes of democracy-that is to say, democracy "with adjectives." The article explores the strengths and weaknesses of alternative strategies of conceptual innovation that have emerged: descending and climbing Sartori's ladder of generality, generating "diminished" subtypes of democracy, "precising" the definition of democracy by adding defining attributes, and shifting the overarching concept with which democracy is associated. The goal of the analysis is to make more comprehensible the complex structure of these strategies, as well as to explore trade-offs among the strategies. Even when scholars proceed intuitively, rather than self-consciously, they tend to operate within this structure. Yet it is far more desirable for them to do so self-consciously, with a full awareness of these trade-offs.},

Giovanni Sartori's work on conceptual "traveling" and conceptual "stretching" provides helpful guidance in addressing this fundamental task of comparative analysis. Yet Sartori's framework draws upon what may be called classical categorization, which views the relation among categories in terms of a taxonomic hierarchy, with each category having clear boundaries and defining properties shared by all members. We examine the challenge to this framework presented by two types of nonclassical categories: family resemblances and radial categories. With such categories, the overly strict application of a classical framework can lead to abandoning to category prematurely or to modifying it inappropriately. We discuss solutions to these problems, using examples of how scholars have adapted their categories in comparative research on democracy and authoritarianism.},

When defining a concept, there is a trade-pff between extension and intension, where, if you want to extend the cases a concept/category covers, the law of inverse variation says that the intention, or meaning, of the concept must be limited to some degree, i.e., it becomes a more general concept/category.
Collier and Mahon also discusses three types of categories: classical, family resemblance, and radial.
The classical category is defined by a superordinate primary category, where adding attributes creates secondary categories that are more specific and, thus, has less intention. The reverse is true for radial categories, where the primary category denotes a high-intention ‘true’ category, and the secondary categories are more realistic categories with greater extent, as they loosen the intention criteria. The family resemblance category is when cases have many similar attributes that together make them a group, but most do not include all the attributes. These are possible, but under the rules of the ladder of generality, making a category to include every case, would remove all the attributes and make the category non-differentiated. 
They argue that Sartori’s ladder mainly works for the classical type of concept/category, while, especially, family resemblance needs looser criteria. 
“The goal of this discussion has been to offer new guidelines for comparative analysts who are concerned with the problems of conceptual traveling and conceptual stretching.” (Collier and Mahon, 1993, p. 852)

This article provides a meta-analysis of 114 studies, demonstrating persisting inconsistencies in the measurement of the mechanisms driving policy diffusion processes. Different indicators are used to measure the same mechanism, and the same indicators are used to measure different mechanisms. To improve this state of affairs, this article puts forward a conceptual structure that serves as a guide for the application of diffusion arguments, a starting point for theoretical refinement and a benchmark to assess measurement validity. In addition to paying more attention to the conceptual consistency of indicators, overcoming the problems currently found in the literature requires the construction of original, innovative research designs instead of the replication of widely used templates.},

By examining three types of antismoking policy choices by the 675 largest U.S. cities between 1975 and 2000, we uncover robust patterns of policy diffusion, yielding three key findings. First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},

The below discussion is important: is the same the case with countries? it seems believable.
“we find that smaller governments face a relative disadvantage in policy formulation in the American federal system. They appear to be less capable of learning from the policy choices of others, more susceptible to economic competition, more likely to engage in simple imitation, and strongly at risk of coercion from their state government.” (Shipan and Volden, 2008, p. 841)
We also have this:
“As is common in the diffusion literature, we believe the individual decision makers within these cities are interested in adopting beneficial policies, either as a means to reelection or reappointment or as an end in themselves” (Shipan and Volden, 2008, p. 841)
“coefficient on the imitation mechanism variable itself (Nearest Bigger City) is cut to less than half of its value between Models 3 and 5. This drop is mainly due to inclusion of the learning variable, indicating that a substantial portion of what previously had appeared to be imitation was due to learning from other cities, including from the nearest larger neighbor.” (Shipan and Volden, 2008, p. 852)

There are two variants of the model; in one, governments only learn from their own experiences, whereas in the other they learn from one another's experiments. Based on similarities between these two versions, we illustrate that much accepted scholarly evidence of policy diffusion could simply have arisen through independent actions by governments that only learn from their own experiences. However, differences between the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic models point the way to future empirical tests that discern learning-based policy diffusion from independent policy adoptions.},

	url = {https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/104158},
	abstract = {Even autocrats are forced to rely on their political allies to remain in power. Min- isters make up a considerable share of these allies in any political regime, and their competency can both aid and threaten the incumbent autocrat’s rule. Consequently, the study of how autocrats balance the trade-off between loyalty and competence in their cabinet appointments is of great importance when aiming to understand the dynamics of autocratic rule. One strain of the existing literature argues that leaders in autocracies reward competence less than democracies. Scholars supporting this argument claim that autocrats will replace competent ministers with less competent ones over time, as the more competent ministers are less likely to be loyal to the autocrat. This competency can be defined as political competency, measured by ministers’ political experience, and technical competency, measured by ministers’ education. Challenging this proposed narrative, I argue that autocrats value technically competent ministers, and will not replace these subordinates as their time in power increases. The case of politically competent ministers, however, is more complex. To analyse how competency levels of cabinets change under the rule of an incumbent, I leverage newly collected data on 45 autocratic countries between 1966 and 2020 from the novel Paths to Power dataset. In contradiction with the theoretical literature on the loyalty-competency trade-off, I find no systematic replacement of technically competent ministers with less competent ones. My analyses reveal that, on average, the share of politically competent ministers in autocratic cabinets decreases over time under the same incumbent. In conclusion, autocrats seem not to fear techni- cally competent ministers, but the preference for politically competent ministers is more complex and regime-dependent. My findings move the literature forward by highlighting the importance of disaggregating the concept of competency and the need for further theoretical development on autocrats’ personnel preferences.},

	abstract = {Authoritarian regimes are frequent targets of international pressure in the form of economic sanctions or threats thereof. Existing research shows that foreign interventions can carry several unintended consequences for politics and the economy in the targeted countries. One of the side effects of such interventions is boosting support for incumbent autocrats. Public demonstrations in support of embattled leaders are one aspect of this dynamic. This article investigates the link between foreign pressure and domestic mobilization in favor of ruling autocrats. It is argued that pressure simultaneously increases regime supporters’ willingness to participate in rallies and the regime’s demand to display and even overstate regime support. Foreign pressure facilitates mobilization as autocrats can fuel nationalist sentiments and frame foreign interventions as an attack on the nation as a whole. At the same time, rallies are a strategic tool to reduce political opportunities for the opposition and to signal resolve to the international community. Empirically, I conduct the first quantitative analysis that evidences the existence of a relationship between international pressure and mobilization in support of incumbent autocrats. Using monthly data on rally events in all authoritarian regimes between 2003 and 2015, I find that sanctions but also threats significantly increase pro-government mobilization. In addition, I show evidence for a moderating role of media freedom in the targeted state, highlighting the importance of how international events are portrayed in national news.},

Drawing on policy diffusion theory (PDT), we argue that these choices are less the product of strategic calculation than of policy emulation and decoupling. Using a mixed methods approach, we show that, while the Confucius Institutes and Russkiy Mir Institutes were modelled after their Western counterparts (emulation), China and Russia have operated their institutes in ways that go against the principles of cultural diplomacy (decoupling). An analysis of field research on these institutes suggests more overall decoupling with Confucius Institutes than with Russkiy Mir Institutes, which might help account for the relatively greater backlash against the Confucius Institutes in their host countries.},

We investigate this challenge involving three major continuous democracy measures: the Freedom House score (FH), the Polity score, and the Regime of the World (RoW) that is based on the V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (EDI). We develop a framework to empirically derive thresholds using categorical democracy measures as benchmarks. Our analyses find that the cut-offs that yield the highest consistency with the classifications of BMR, CGV, and GWF are 3.5 for FH, 5 for Polity and 0.39 for EDI/RoW. These levels are lower than the conventional cut-offs, implying less demanding democratic standards. Consequently, the conventional cut-offs (2.5 for FH, 6 for Polity and 0.5 for EDI/RoW) endeavour to reflect more stringent standards of democracy than what these dichotomous measures employ.},

While these democracy measures use radically different methodologies, most partially or fully rely on subjective judgments to produce estimates of the level of democracy within states. Such projects continuously grapple with balancing conceptual coverage with the potential for bias (Munck and Verkuilen 2002; Przeworski et al. 2000). Little and Meng (L\&M) (2023) reintroduce this debate, arguing that “objective” measures of democracy show little evidence of recent global democratic backsliding.1 By extension, they posit that time-varying expert bias drives the appearance of democratic retrenchment in measures that incorporate expert judgments. In this article, we engage with (1) broader debates on democracy measurement and democratic backsliding, and (2) L\&M’s specific data and conclusions.},

This major book analyzes recent transitions to democracy and market-oriented economic reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Drawing in a quite distinctive way on models derived from political philosophy, economics, and game theory, Professor Przeworski also considers specific data on individual countries. Among the questions raised by the book are: What should we expect from these experiments in democracy and market economy?  What new economic systems will emerge? Will these transitions result in new democracies or old dictatorships?},

However, the actual extent to which they undermine democratic governance in foreign countries remains contested. What roles do China and Russia play in contemporary backsliding? Under what conditions do they succeed or fail in spreading illiberal practices? China and Russia promote discrete illiberal practices in different places, but their efforts do not always succeed. While certain foreign policy strategies have effectively attracted and empowered like-minded foreign actors, others have obstructed political diffusion instead. We argue that the Chinese governance model of digital authoritarianism has increasingly spread to the periphery of the dominant international order after 2014. On the other hand, the Russian model of super-presidentialism, once prevalent in the former Soviet bloc, has experienced significant setbacks after 2014, when Russia increasingly came to be perceived as a security threat. We present corroborating evidence through difference-in-differences analyses and additional validation using placebo tests. This research sheds light on the international dimensions of democratic backsliding and reconciles conflicting findings in the literature by identifying distinct Chinese and Russian models, as well as the conditions under which their diffusion succeeded or faltered.},

Now we have a way to track and quantify this intensifying competition across time using the Formal Bilateral Influence Capacity (FBIC) Index, a new measure of influence between pairs of states from 1960 through 2020. Spanning economic, political, and security dimensions, the FBIC Index attempts to capture 1) the volume of interactions between pairs of countries and 2) the dependence that one country has on the other. Why this two-pronged approach? Two countries that interact more frequently and across more dimensions of activity are more likely to have opportunities to exert influence on one another. A country with high levels of dependence on another for its economic activity or security, for example, can be more easily influenced. We refer to the combination of these factors as "influence capacity."},

Where ties to the West were limited, external democratizing pressure was weaker and countries rarely democratized. In these cases, regime outcomes hinged on the character of state and ruling party organizations. Where incumbents possessed developed and cohesive coercive party structures, they could thwart opposition challenges, and competitive authoritarian regimes survived; where incumbents lacked such organizational tools, regimes were unstable but rarely democratized.},

	abstract = {Democracy is under threat across the globe and a third wave of autocratization manifests in democratic regression and authoritarian hardening. However, although universities have been important pro-democracy hotbeds, the nexus between academic freedom and autocratization has generated little scholarly attention. This article presents the first systematic investigation of the influence of academic freedom on the onset of autocratization. In particular, it reveals how academic freedom protects regimes from an onset of autocratization and argues that more academic freedom reduces the risk of autocratization by imprinting a pro-democracy bias on students and researchers. This article’s research design combines two studies. Study I tests whether graduates that were socialized under more academic freedom develop more democratic support, which I analyse using data from the World Values Surveys and linear fixed effects models. Study II tests whether more academic freedom reduces the onset probability of autocratization using V-Dem data and binomial-response GLMs. This article finds evidence that while high levels of academic freedom reduce the probability of an onset of autocratization, low levels also reduce the probability of an onset. Overall, the article highlights the crucial role of academic freedom for democracy, especially in times of severe threats to democracy.},

This paper studies these questions by analysing five waves of Asian Barometer Survey data from 2002 to 2019. We have three major findings. First, the shift of political values exhibits an inverted U-shaped curve with the mid-2010s as its turning point. Second, the better educated and more media exposed turned conservative much faster than the rest after the mid-2010s. Third, to trace the mechanism of this unusual reversal and divergence, we resort to a Difference-In-Differences model, taking political indoctrination, measured by media exposure and education, as treatment and the post-2013 era as treatment time, finding that political indoctrination significantly explains political cultural backsliding. Our findings enrich modernization theory by identifying the “interceptive” power of the state between economic development and cultural shifts.},

With this rejoinder we make three arguments: First, the question how global waves shape autocratization processes and regime transformations is now more urgent than ever. Since 1994, civil liberties and political rights of one third of the global population have been substantially and increasingly reduced due to autocratization. Second, waves of any concept can only be studied meaningfully if the underlying concepts as well as the waves are clearly defined. We argue that the conceptualization of episodes of regime transformations (ERT) in the ERT dataset provides exactly such a clear state-of-the-art empirical mapping of processes of democratization and autocratization at the national level. In addition, we highlight how our conceptualization of waves builds upon Huntington, 1993. It even improves upon it by allowing for overlap and modelling it closer to its real world counterpart. Third, we view the present debate as a prime example of fruitful scholastic argument. Ultimately, this is what will generate a better understanding of global trends of democratization and autocratization.},

On the pages of Democratization, a crucial debate recently emerged when Svend-Erik Skaaning reacted to the high-impact 2018 article by Anna Lührmann and Staffan Lindberg. This piece aims to contribute to this stimulating debate. The main message of this piece is: don’t think of a wave! Autocratization matters and deserves to be studied, even if there is no such a “third wave.” This research note claims that steering the debate on the concept of wave(s), which is of limited analytical and explanatory power, is misleading and risks taking the entire discussion down a blind alley. In the second part, the research note discusses some of the open issues of this literature, and in particular a) the very conceptualization of autocratization and b) the problem of thresholds and false positives. In the same way, the third part deals with three new areas of inquiry: c) the multi-dimensional nature of autocratization d) the multi-level dimension of autocratization and e) the opposition to autocratization.},

During this period, China’s economic assistance, diplomatic backing and military exchanges have cemented it as the ruling Cambodian People’s Party’s (CPP) most important foreign partner. This article’s findings support the linkage thesis: that ties between authoritarian regimes enhance their survival in moments of crisis. The article provides evidence for the specific forms of linkages that proved vital to the CPP during a transition from competitive to hegemonic authoritarianism. It shows that alongside more familiar linkage ties, the CPP also drew on more diffuse types of authoritarian cooperation and emulation, while Chinese discourses on non-interference and the right to develop provided an authoritarian nexus supporting CPP legitimation narratives in defiance of challengers. The article reflects on Cambodia’s variant of hegemonic authoritarianism in light of these observations. Finally, the argument draws attention to leverage exercised on Cambodia by China as a consequence of these linkages, which have been beneficial to China’s strategic and military interests in Southeast Asia. In the current moment of autocratization and great power competition globally, this has implications for research beyond Cambodia.},

	abstract = {Democratic regression has become a worrying phenomenon in the last years. Social science has provided a variety of explanations why democratic regimes have lost democratic regime quality. Against this backdrop, I take stock of the recent literature by putting forward two important analytical distinctions that we should make more explicit. First, I propose to classify our current explanations along the source where the cause for the malaise originated. By doing so, I introduce a distinction between erosion and decay type of arguments. While the former is a gradual process that is caused exogenously – like wind or water hitting a stone – the latter is caused endogenously – like the half-life in nuclear decay processes. Second, I draw a distinction between the endogenous or exogenous roots of the cause and the subsequent causal mechanism that connects the cause with the outcome. I outline the need for dissecting a causal mechanism into its constitutive components and highlight its underlying dimensions of temporality. Throughout the article, I use empirical case material as well as relevant secondary literature to illustrate these points.},

The time frame covered are the years 2013 to early 2020. In 2013, China officially launched its New Silk Road initiative, building cross-continental connectivity networks and trans-regional trade corridors. The internal stability of states along this New Silk Road is of crucial importance for the realization of Beijing’s ambitious plan. How, then, does China view and interpret regime (trans)formations in its immediate neighbourhood? Is there any robust evidence for intentional agency (or counter-agency) of China in these processes? The article examines three case studies of “democratic regression” and “autocratic hardening” in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia) and compares the findings to China’s special relationship with Vietnam – like China a socialist one-party state.},

However, a global democratic recession began in 2006 and has persisted – and deepened – over the past 14 years. Not only have average levels of freedom (or democratic quality) been declining globally and in most parts of the world, but the pace of democratic breakdown accelerated and the number of democratic transitions declined, particularly in the past five years. Democratic regression is particularly visible among the G-20 countries and other most populous and geopolitically weighty countries, 19 of which have declined in freedom during the democratic recession, with only two improving. The principal method of democratic regression has been incremental strangulation of democracy by elected (typically populist) executives who gradually eviscerate institutional checks, political opposition, independent media, and other forces of scrutiny and resistance in civil society. Weak and declining rule of law has predisposed regimes to democratic regression, enabling ambitious rulers to hollow out political competition. But international factors have also been crucial, generating common economic and social stresses while lifting the constraints and lowering the risks autocrats face as they inaugurate or accelerate the slide into authoritarianism.},

Based on an alternative conceptualization of waves of regime change and novel data on episodes of democratization and autocratization, Lührmann and Lindberg identify three waves of autocratization where the most recent and ongoing began in 1994, affects a higher number of democracies, and unfolds relatively slowly and piecemeal. In this note, however, I argue that both their definition and their measurement of waves of democratization and autocratization are questionable. First, their operationalization of regime changes do not capture all degrees of change and it provides a skewed account since the criteria used to identify episodes of autocratization and democratization are not balanced. Second, their definition of waves of regime change deviates from the conventional understandings as it emphasizes relative trends in the number of upturns and downsturns rather than looking at the relative size or the relative number of autocratizations vis-à-vis democratizations. The last part of the article shows that an alternative, more intuitively appealing understanding and operationalization supports different conclusions regarding the periodization of waves.},

Linkages with the West are supposed to facilitate democratization, whereas those with autocracies usually promote regime survival. This study focuses on Myanmar and Thailand’s linkages with the U.S. and China, which at first sight seem to demonstrate the hypothesized effects. Myanmar gradually liberalized while strengthening its Western linkages, whereas Thailand experienced democratic breakdown amid a shift in alignment from the U.S. to China. However, in-depth analysis suggests that the influence of foreign linkages on domestic political change was minimal and that the relationship may very well be endogenous. The findings of this study call for a more careful theorization and handling of the external factors in studies of regime change and highlight the importance of simultaneously analyzing democratic and autocratic linkages.},

In the 1990s, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) entered this research field but a tally shows that the number of democratization studies using this method has so far been low and there is little evidence of any take-off. We review a series of landmark studies that use explanatory typologies and 16 studies that use QCA to see how they fare on three criteria: alignment between hypotheses and methods, the strength of causal claims, and the employment of robustness tests. The review shows that most of the QCA applications devote too little attention to formulating set-theoretic propositions and to carrying out robustness tests. Moreover, many scholars are too quick to interpret their findings as causal relationships, especially in light of the modest use of within-case evidence. Finally, it is striking that virtually none of these analyses has influenced the literature in the way some of the studies combining simple explanatory typologies with within-case analysis have. Against this backdrop, we discuss the potential of QCA for democratization research.},

Three important challenges create difficulty for scholars who seek to assess the state of knowledge in this domain. First, most existing work on the origins of democracy starts (often without any explicit discussion) from the supposition that the key causes of democracy are largely randomly assigned. Second, much existing literature is far from specific about which of many methodological changes produces a new finding — making it hard for scholars to know how to interpret any resulting changes in the causal inference. Finally standards for credible statistical research have evolved and improved over time, requiring scholars to periodically decrement the credibility they attach to existing findings. This essay closes with ideas about how research in this domain might be improved by closer attention to detail and replication, by greater use of alternative strategies for causal inference including forward path analysis, and by a broader use of contemporary statistical tools for optimal multivariate description.},

As has the broader discipline, democratization research has experienced four methodological “disruptions” over the past 60 years: the behavioural revolution of statistical methodology; the introduction of formal theory; the sophistication of qualitative, set-theoretic and multi-method research; and the increasing use of experimental methods. Surveying the methods practices in the past quarter century, we find that quantitative and multi-method research have been growth areas in recent years, but that the bulk of research is still done in comparative or single case studies. Formal theory as well as set-theoretic methods have gained a foothold in the field, but it is still a small one. In sum, democratization research is, methodologically speaking, still rather traditional. Moreover, the individual contributions to this special issue show that much of the empirical literature underutilizes the best available advice about how to develop and test theory, including standards on causal inference, case-selection, and generalization. We conclude with a plea for more transparency, humility, and collaboration within and across methodological traditions.},

	abstract = {Experts worry that de facto single-person regimes in previous multiparty states (Russia, Turkey, Venezuela) and norm-defiance in existing democracies (Brazil, Hungary, the United States) signal a coming authoritarian age. Without examining the broader record, however, it is hard to know whether such tremors presage a global convulsion. A century's worth of evidence (1920–2019) shows that contemporary democracies are sturdier than they look. Above all, high levels of economic development continue to sustain multipartism; OECD democracies have faced less risk than often intimated. Further, competition among political parties, regardless of national affluence, contains a momentum that even the most willful demagogues have had trouble stopping. These economic and institutional bulwarks help explain why democratic backsliding, which seems so portentous, has preceded democratic survival more often than breakdown. Even as executive aggrandizement and rancorous partisanship roil the world's most venerable democracies, they are unlikely to produce new autocracies absent permissive material conditions.},

Liberal democracies must also be clear about why the alternative they offer is better. They should define and promote liberal-democratic values, and invest heavily in protecting them.},

More important, however, is a global generational shift from authoritarian values toward emancipative ones. Emancipative values tie democratic support increasingly tightly to liberal principles. Emancipative-values holders are more likely to resist attempts by autocrats or populists to deny or limit democratic freedoms. Slowly but steadily, this cultural undercurrent is shifting legitimacy from autocracy to democracy in most world regions. Democracy's future is bright.},

In the United Nations, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) misuses its seat on the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Committee on Non-governmental Organizations (NGO Committee) to block applications from civil society organizations seeking UN consultative status. Consultative status enables NGOs to participate in UN activities, including hosting side events, gaining access to sessions, speaking at UN events and delivering statements. While the NGO Committee was originally created to facilitate civil society’s participation within the UN, China (along with other authoritarian countries) have instead used it to restrict NGO access to the UN. Chinese diplomats not only block applications from NGOs working on human rights issues (including those focused on North Korea) but also enforce the one-China policy by asking applicants to explicitly recognize Tibet and Taiwan as integral parts of Chinese territory and resisting groups engaged in advocacy on Uyghur issues. In UN reports on the NGO Committee’s deliberations and interviews with diplomats, UN officials and NGO representatives provide compelling evidence that Beijing seeks to contain NGOs and has worked with the Like-Minded Group (LMG), a coalition of authoritarian countries, to cap the role of civil society in the UN and bar many organizations from participation in this global body.},

We collect comprehensive data on the external messaging of the Chinese and American governments. We then conduct a randomized experiment in 19 countries across six continents exposing global citizens to real messages from the Chinese and American governments’ external media arms. We find that exposure to a representative set of Chinese messages strengthens perceptions that the Chinese Communist Party delivers growth, stability, and competent leadership. It also moves the average respondent from slightly preferring the American model to slightly preferring the Chinese model. In head-to-head matchups, messages from the US government are less persuasive. Our findings show how autocracies build global support by selling growth and competence, with important implications for democratic resilience.},

We administer a conjoint survey experiment across 141 LMICs to elicit the aid preferences of elites who are uniquely close to development policy debates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that elites favor larger over smaller projects, grants over loans, and transportation infrastructure projects over initiatives focused on civil society or tax collection capacity. But contrary to the aid curse theory, elites also prefer projects with transparent terms and labor, corruption, and environmental regulations, and are at worst indifferent towards good governance conditionalities. These preferences hold even in corrupt and autocratic countries and even among high-level government officials who might be expected to favor “no-strings-attached” aid regimes.},

Yet a close look at twelve important cases of recent backsliding casts doubt on this thesis, finding that while it has some explanatory power in some cases, it has little in others, and even where it applies, it requires nuanced interpretation. Backsliding is less a result of democracies failing to deliver than of democracies failing to constrain the predatory political ambitions and methods of certain elected leaders. Policymakers and aid providers seeking to limit backsliding should tailor their diplomatic and aid interventions accordingly.},

The term ‘freedom of expression’ includes free speech, freedom of the press, the right to petition government, and freedom of political association. Eighteenth-century proponents of popular government had long offered democratic justifications for freedom of expression. The chapter then demonstrates that freedom of political expression is a necessary component of democracy. It describes two core functions of such expression: an informing and a legitimating one. Finally, the chapter examines the concept of ‘democracy’, noting various ways in which democracies vary among themselves, as well as the implications of those variations for freedom of expression.

This is a complicated and irredeemably controversial undertaking. Although “democracy” and “dictatorship” are concepts of everyday usage, the intuitions we associate with them are not always sufficient to determine that a particular country operated according to one or the other at a given time. Thus we must formalize these concepts in terms of rules that can be decisively and reliably applied to the observable aspects of national histories. And once we have such rules, we must apply them. Any such procedure necessitates going back and forth between conceptual analysis and historical observation. Closure is difficult to reach: In some cases, history simply has not generated the information called for by the rules, and we must accept the fact that there will be systematic errors. Other cases are so idiosyncratic that we must accept the fact that they have to be treated as random errors. Nevertheless, although no classification can be free of errors, the encouraging lesson is that independent endeavors by different researchers have led to very similar results.Although several classifications of regimes, covering different periods and sets of countries, are now available, they can, in our view, be improved by (1) a better grounding in political theory, (2) exclusive reliance on observables, rather than on subjective judgments, (3) an explicit distinction between systematic and random errors, and (4) more extensive coverage.},

The goal of the symposium is to bring quite different and often isolated schools of thought into contact and communication with one another, and to define common metrics by which we can judge the utility of the contending approaches to diffusion across different policy domains.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, studies have documented how autocrats use elections as a way of legitimising and stabilising their regimes. Simultaneously, a literature on negative external actors (also known as ‘black knights’) has developed, emphasising how various international actors use anti-democracy promotion strategies to undergird authoritarian regimes. In this article, these two literatures are fused in an attempt to shed light on the external dimension of authoritarian elections and what is termed ‘black knight election bolstering’. First, five mechanisms are elucidated, through which external assistance increases the chances of ‘winning’ elections in authoritarian settings (signaling invincibility, deterring elite defection, undermining opposition activities, dealing with popular protests, and countervailing pressure from foreign democracy promoters). Second, it is argued that external actors are most likely to offer election bolstering when they face a particularly acquiescent partner or when electoral defeat is perceived to lead to radical and undesired regime change. The relevance of both factors is augmented when uncertainty of the electoral outcome is high. Finally, four cases of Russian intervention during elections in three authoritarian neighbour countries (Ukraine in 2004, Belarus in 2006, and Moldova in 2005 and 2009) are analysed. The case studies corroborate the theoretical arguments: not only does Russia engage in all five types of black knight election bolstering, but it does so only when one or more of the three explanatory factors are present.},

In order to generate a better understanding of the nature and effects of these international dimensions of authoritarianism, this article provides a conceptual framework for various aspects of authoritarian collaboration to prevent democracy, particularly the relationship between authoritarian regime types and their international democracy-prevention policies. It differentiates between authoritarian diffusion, learning, collaboration and support, as well as between deliberate efforts to avert democracy and efforts not explicitly geared towards strengthening autocracy. The article further distinguishes between crisis events and normal conditions where authoritarian rulers' hold on power is not in danger. It is argued that authoritarian powers' motivations to provide support to fellow autocrats are self-serving rather than driven by an ideological commitment to creating an ‘authoritarian international’: authoritarian rulers first and foremost strive to maximise their own survival chances by selectively supporting acquiescent authoritarian regimes, maintaining geostrategic control and fostering their developmental goals.},

	abstract = {In recent years, observers have raised concerns about threats to democracy posed by external support for authoritarianism coming from regional powers such as Russia, China and Venezuela. This article assesses the efficacy of autocracy promotion through a close examination of Russian efforts to shape regime outcomes in the former Soviet Union. It finds that while Russian actions have periodically promoted instability and secessionist conflict, there is little evidence that such intervention has made post-Soviet countries less democratic than they would have been otherwise. First, the Russian government has been inconsistent in its support for autocracy – supporting opposition and greater pluralism in countries where anti-Russian governments are in power, and incumbent autocrats in cases where pro-Russian politicians dominate. At the same time, the Russian government's narrow concentration on its own economic and geopolitical interests has significantly limited the country's influence, fostering a strong counter-reaction in countries with strong anti-Russian national identities. Finally, Russia's impact on democracy in the region has been restricted by the fact that post-Soviet countries already have weak democratic prerequisites. This analysis suggests that, despite increasingly aggressive foreign policies by autocratic regional powers, autocracy promotion does not present a particularly serious threat to democracy in the world today.},

Autocracies not only resist the global spread of democracy, but are developing their own domestic efforts in the promotion of autocracy. This study argues that processes at the regional level aim at the dissemination and diffusion of autocratic norms, structures, processes, policy approaches or practices. Likewise, we propose that authoritarian gravity centres can be attributed with both the active promotion of autocracy as well as the inducement of diffusion effects.

The scope and extent of connections with other democratic countries in a region can strengthen support for democratic reform and help sustain institutions in transitional democracies. Results from a transition model demonstrate that international factors can exert a strong influence on the prospects for transitions to democracy, and the spatial clustering in democracy and transitions cannot adequately be explained by the hypothesized domestic social requisites of individual countries.},

However, to date, studies testing the impact of modernization on political regimes have almost completely focused on democracies. We aim at broadening the discussion to autocracies and ask the following research question: What impact has economic development on the survival of different types of autocracy? Using data covering 1946 to 2016, we ascertain – mainly through logistic regression analysis – that the level of economic development affects not only the endurance of democracies but also that of various types of autocracy. In more detail, we find that economic development prolongs the survival of ideocracies and personalist autocracies. The effect of economic modernization on military dictatorships, monarchies and electoral autocracies is very limited. In contrast, one party autocracies are the only regime type whose survival chances (moderately) decrease with modernization.},

There is no strong evidence suggesting that the regime's popular foundation is highly or exclusively dependent on its superior economic performance or its manipulation of nationalist zeal.

Exercises have been added at the end of each chapter. Prerequisites for this book include an understanding of mathematical statistics at the level of Bickel and Doksum (1977), some understanding of the Bayesian approach as in Box and Tiao (1973), some exposure to statistical models as found in McCullagh and NeIder (1989), and for Section 6. 6 some experience with condi­ tional inference at the level of Cox and Snell (1989). I have chosen not to present proofs of convergence or rates of convergence for the Metropolis algorithm or the Gibbs sampler since these may require substantial background in Markov chain theory that is beyond the scope of this book. However, references to these proofs are given. There has been an explosion of papers in the area of Markov chain Monte Carlo in the past ten years. I have attempted to identify key references-though due to the volatility of the field some work may have been missed.},

(2022). By analyzing three distinct components of data quality (content validity, the data generation process, and convergent validity), this article examines the specific strengths and potential shortcomings of the AFI. The findings indicate that the AFI does well in terms of its theoretical embeddedness (within some conceptual limits), of the transparent data generation process and the handling of expert assessments, as well as of its temporal and spatial coverage. A critical assessment of the level of disagreement between expert coders further shows that there are few systematic predictors, providing no evidence for problematic biases among AFI coders. Overall, we conclude that the data quality of the AFI is comparatively high but that it could be further increased by recruiting even more experts and thereby enhancing the Bayesian IRT model’s performance.},

	abstract = {While the definition of extended conceptions of democracy has been widely discussed, the measurement of these constructs has not attracted similar attention. In this article we present new measures of polyarchy, liberal democracy, deliberative democracy, egalitarian democracy, and participatory democracy that cover most polities in the period 1900 to 2013. These indices are based on data from a large number of indicators collected through the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project. We present and discuss the theoretical considerations and the concrete formula underlying the aggregation of indicators and components into high level measures of democracy. In addition, we show how these measures reflect variations in quality of democracy, given the respective ideals, in 2012. In the conclusion scholars are encouraged to make use of the rich dataset made available by V-Dem.},

Controlling for human capital (or real GDP per capita) and openness measures, dynamic panel methods address endogeneity from more democratic regimes demanding better control of rents. We find that democracy responds positively to natural resource rents in GDP (NAT) and negatively to terms of trade (TOT). The NAT positive effects mitigate the negative impact of TOT on democracy and holds well in different specifications. By building on a literature focusing on oil rents, increases in NAT (extra revenue over production costs) represent a windfall for mining companies. This leads society to require higher levels of participation in decisions to exploit these rents more transparently. We also find that diversification of rents helps democracy, especially in economies with high shares of oil rents.},

The authors present empirical evidence suggesting a robust and negative correlation between the presence of a sizable natural resource sector and the level of democracy in Africa. They argue that resource abundance not only is an important determinant of democratic transition but also partially determines the success of democratic consolidation in Africa. The results illuminate the fact that post-Cold War democratic reforms have been successful only in resource-poor countries such as Benin, Mali, and Madagascar. The authors argue that resource-rich countries such as Nigeria and Gabon can become democratic only if they introduce strong mechanisms of vertical and horizontal accountability within the state.},

Instead of terrorizing citizens into submission, "informational autocrats" artificially boost their popularity by convincing the public they are competent. To do so, they use propaganda and silence informed members of the elite by co-optation or censorship. Using several sources, including a newly created dataset on authoritarian control techniques, we document a range of trends in recent autocracies consistent with this new model: a decline in violence, efforts to conceal state repression, rejection of official ideologies, imitation of democracy, a perceptions gap between the masses and the elite, and the adoption by leaders of a rhetoric of performance rather than one aimed at inspiring fear.},

Less optimistic observers, on the other hand, contend that ICT is a tool of repression in the hands of autocrats, imposing further restrictions on political and social liberties. We investigate whether the liberation- or the repression-technology perspective can better explain empirically observed patterns. To this end, we analyze two outcomes. First, we look at which autocracies are more likely to adopt and expand the Internet. In line with the repression technology expectation, we find that regimes aiming to prevent any independent public sphere are more likely to introduce the Internet. Second, we study the effects of the Internet on changes towards democracy. This analysis reveals no effect of the Internet on political institutions. These findings provide moderate support for the 'repression technology' perspective, and suggest that the Internet has not – at least in its first two decades of existence – contributed to a global shift towards democracy.},

Yet such a strategy risks facilitating a coordinated uprising if discontent is revealed to be widespread. A formal model shows that under some conditions, a regime optimally permits investigative reporting on lower-level officialdom, adjusting how much reporting is allowed depending on the level of underlying social tensions. This strategy yields many of the benefits of free media without risking overthrow. An extension shows why an increase in uncontrollable information, such as from the Internet, may result in a reduction in media freedom. The model sheds light on important aspects of China's media policy and its evolution and on authoritarian media control more broadly.},

To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.},

Despite this stance, little theoretical attention or empirical investigation has attempted to ascertain why or whether this relationship truly exists. One challenge to answering this puzzle is that extant theories of international institutions do not generally delineate clear hypotheses about how IOs influence domestic politics. In this article, I address this paucity of both theory and empirical evidence. I delineate three causal mechanisms that link IOs to domestic actors' calculations about political liberalization and test the argument. I find that membership in regional IOs is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from 1950 to 1992.},

	abstract = {This text starts by explaining the fundamental goal of good political science research-the ability to answer interesting and important questions by generating valid inferences about political phenomena. Before the text even discusses the process of developing a research question, the authors introduce the reader to what it means to make an inference and the different challenges that social scientists face when confronting this task. Only with this ultimate goal in mind will students be able to ask appropriate questions, conduct fruitful literature reviews, select and execute the proper research design, and critically evaluate the work of others.
The authors' primary goal is to teach students to critically evaluate their own research designs and others' and analyze the extent to which they overcome the classic challenges to making inference: internal and external validity concerns, omitted variable bias, endogeneity, measurement, sampling, and case selection errors, and poor research questions or theory. As such, students will not only be better able to conduct political science research, but they will also be more savvy consumers of the constant flow of causal assertions that they confront in scholarship, in the media, and in conversations with others.
Three themes run through Barakso, Sabet, and Schaffner's text: minimizing classic research problems to making valid inferences, effective presentation of research results, and the nonlinear nature of the research process. Throughout their academic years and later in their professional careers, students will need to effectively convey various bits of information. Presentation skills gleaned from this text will benefit students for a lifetime, whether they continue in academia or in a professional career.

	abstract = {Timor-Leste has had three rounds of major elections, all of which have been widely regarded as meeting international criteria for being free and fair. There has also been one change of government on the basis of these elections. On these grounds, some observers have suggested that Timor-Leste has met the benchmark for having consolidated its democracy. Timor-Leste can be said to meet the criteria for an expanded minimalist definition of democracy, holding regular, free and fair elections within an open competitive political environment, with relatively little violence and intimidation and general freedom of expression. This political process has, as defined by the literature, also consolidated. However, Timor-Leste continues to face future economic challenges. The literature indicates that states with high levels of poverty, unemployment and with food shortages are more prone to political instability. Given that Timor-Leste's political party system relies heavily on charismatic individuals and, apart from Fretilin, has poor party structures, loss of current political leaders will add a further destabilising effect. Expected economic problems are likely to manifest around the same time that the current generation of political leaders are no longer active. The question will be, in this increasingly challenging environment, whether Timor-Leste can sustain its democracy.},

	abstract = {The idea of democratic state-building constituted the basis of the peace promotion engagement of the United Nations and other international agencies in Timor-Leste. Yet, this process of internationally assisted socio-political reconstruction has produced mixed results in terms of achieving a liberal democratic transformation. In accounting for these outcomes, the existing scholarship highlights the ways in which the intensifying power struggles between different competing social groups gave rise to a socio-political order where clientelist, neo-patrimonial governance structures and practices co-exist with those of the Western Weberian state. This article draws on social conflict theory to examine the underlying political economy dynamics of these governance outcomes. It concludes that the process of socio-political ordering experienced in Timor-Leste is not a deviation from the liberal democratic blueprint. It rather results from it, reflects the balance of power between competing groups in society, and develops in such a way that serves the interests of particular social forces while marginalising others. Following from this premise, the article emphasises the point that the analysis of the political environment in Timor-Leste should consider the state-society complex rather than focusing on the quality of state institutions misguidedly insulated from societal interest and influence.},

	abstract = {China’s military modernization has been a central plank of President Xi Jinping’s policy agenda. Historically, China’s arms makers have focused almost exclusively on supplying the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). However, over the last decade, they have begun to look for overseas markets to supplement sales and support Beijing’s geopolitical goals. Arms sales are an often-overlooked aspect of China’s global security and economic footprint and can present challenges to European arms makers in overlapping markets. European policymakers and corporates need more knowledge and awareness of this issue. This edition of the China Global Competition Tracker looks at China’s arms industry and its footprint overseas. First, MERICS Lead Analyst Helena Legarda examines Beijing’s strategy of arms sales overseas and how it might develop in the future. Next, Lead Analyst Jacob Gunter looks into Norinco, one of China’s key land equipment makers, as a representative example of the overseas push by China arms industry. , China aims to expand its overseas arms sales, but is beset with headwinds China has established itself as a major arms exporter, building on years of military modernization policies that have strengthened its defense industry. Beijing has set its sights on exporting arms as China is now able to produce most of its military equipment domestically, reducing its dependence on imports from Russia and elsewhere. Sales teams from China’s ten major defense SOEs operate across the globe in search of new customers and in support of Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions. The strategy is paying off. China had 5.8 percent of all global arms exports between 2019 and 2023, making it the fourth largest supplier of conventional weapons, after the United States, France and Russia. Roughly 40 countries purchased Chinese military equipment in the 2019-2023 period, despite the Covid-induced drop in China’s share of global arms exports in those years. Today, Chinese weapons are gradually becoming dominant in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, and are making inroads in Central Asia and the Middle East. There are economic and geopolitical implications for European governments and arms industries, though the intensity of the competition should not be overstated. Chinese arms exporters still face serious limitations that could constrain further sales growth.An indiscriminate, cost-effective providerChina’s success in expanding its overseas arms sales rests on the attractiveness of its offer to developing nations. First, Beijing exports nearly every category of conventional military equipment, from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile systems to submarines, naval vessels and fighter aircraft. Chinese weapons providers also benefit from Beijing’s absence from key international arms control pacts intended to regulate trade in conventional weapons (the Wassenaar Arrangement) and missile technology and delivery systems (the Missile Technology Control Regime). Despite the growing export restrictions on armed UAVs imposed by Beijing, this means that Chinese firms are able to sell certain platforms, such as some types of armed drones, that European or US firms are banned from exporting. Nonetheless, Beijing does not allow export of China’s most advanced variants, to preserve its military advantage. So far, platforms such as China’s 5th generation J-20 fighter remain exclusively for PLA use.Chinese platforms sell for less than Western equivalents and their makers often offer flexible payment conditions. Buyers may also perceive Chinese weapons exports as having fewer strings attached than Western ones.Chinese firms sell indiscriminately. They have demonstrated their willingness to sell equipment to all kinds of governments and regimes, without regard for their human rights record, degree of stability, or likely intentions for using the weapons. China has continued selling weapons to Myanmar throughout the ongoing civil war, for example, and there is some evidence of Chinese-made drones originally sold to nearby countries being used during the war in Yemen. Chinese providers reportedly do not demand end-user certificates, which are meant to prevent weapons sales from being diverted to other actors and to ensure authorized users use them only for authorized purposes. Chinese arms makers’ indiscriminate sales approach is one reason why most Chinese arms manufacturers appear on the United States’s sanctions lists. Some Chinese firms’ (such as Norinco’s) military support for Iran triggered some of the earliest such sanctions in 2003. The list expanded rapidly under the Trump and Biden administrations. Chinese arms makers tend to be listed for their part in modernizing the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and assistance towards Russia’s war in Ukraine. The EU has no equivalent sanctions on China’s arms industry, although it has maintained an arms embargo on China since 1989.Pushing to growChina is pushing to expand its global market share, zeroing in on geopolitically important regions such as South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. Sales bring clear economic benefits to its defense sector state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the sluggish national economy. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows arms revenue made up 27 percent of Norinco’s total revenue in 2022, and 25 percent at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China’s (AVIC). Although these are far lower shares than Lockheed Martin’s 90 percent or Raytheon’s 59 percent, they are nonetheless significant numbers for some of China’s largest SOEs. China’s arms exports are also a tool in Beijing’s geopolitical arsenal, as arms exports can lay the foundation for closer ties on other issues. Beijing is able to use arms sales to build influence and closer partnerships with nations in the Global South, which serves its strategic goal of forging a coalition of countries to push back against Western dominance. China’s share of arms imports in the Americas and the Middle East remains small: US and European suppliers continue to be dominant in those regions, but Beijing is rapidly making inroads in Africa and in Asia. China’s share of total arms exports to all of Africa has remained largely stable since 2009 (at around 12 percent), unable to compete with the United States and Europe. But the dynamics are shifting in Sub-Saharan Africa, where China has become the top supplier, overtaking Russia. China’s share of arms exports to South and Southeast Asia is also growing rapidly, partly thanks to sharp drops in Russian exports since the start of full-scale war against Ukraine.China’s arms offer has limitationsChina’s arms exports are not growing evenly. They are, in fact, extremely concentrated in a handful of regions and countries. Between 2019 and 2023, 85 percent of all Chinese arms exports went to Asian countries, and 61 percent went to a single state: Pakistan. Islamabad purchases the bulk of its military equipment from China, despite being a NATO global partner. Pakistan has even signed agreements to co-produce the JF-17 fighter jet, the K-8 light attack aircraft and other Chinese systems. China remains a relatively niche arms provider, selling mainly less advanced weapons at a low price point to a small number of countries. Outside of a handful of nations, such as Pakistan or Bangladesh, most buyers of Chinese weapons are one-off or ad hoc customers, which limits the customer base of Chinese weapons makers and can give an inflated impression of the global reach and spread of Chinese arms exports. Chinese firms’ only-partial success at expanding their global customer base is because of the limitations of their offer. Chinese weapons are largely untested in combat and also suffer from quality and performance problems. Importing countries may lack personnel with the expertise to resolve technical issues that emerge, or face problems obtaining replacement parts. Chinese suppliers have often shown little accountability in such cases. Nigeria, for example, had to return seven of the nine F-7 fighters it had purchased to China in 2020 for maintenance as it was unable to get them serviced locally by the supplier. Myanmar reportedly ended up having to ground the majority of Chinese jets used by its military in 2022 because of structural cracks and issues with their radar systems. Western countries, in particular the United States, have also warned repeatedly that Chinese systems cannot and will not be integrated with Western-produced ones, largely for interoperability and security reasons. Countries that operate more advanced Western weapons systems or wish to buy them face a clear choice between Chinese weapons or US and European ones. The threat of Western sanctions has also constrained China’s ability to sell weapons to Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, forcing China to limit itself to transferring dual-use technologies and components. This shows that Europe and the United States, if they can achieve consensus, have some leverage to shape third countries’ arms buying decisions, but also the willingness of Chinese firms to sell to sanctioned countries. True competitors?Below the surface, the numbers show most countries purchase the majority of their weapons either from China or from NATO allies, including Europe and the United States. However, there are a handful of notable exceptions. Pakistan and Thailand continue to buy from both China and Western suppliers, likely leveraging their status as NATO partners and US allies. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is the only country to appear in the top 10 recipients list for both China and NATO allies in the 10 years between 2013 and 2023. Nonetheless the difference in volume is staggering: 28,448 million in SIPRI’s trend-indicator values (TIV) from NATO allies compared to only 366 million from China. Chinese firms are trying to break through this either/or pattern by adapting some of their products. Some Chinese equipment such as tanks or aircraft reportedly use standard NATO fitments for accessories and parts, to make the acquisition of parts easier in the global market. At the 2024 Eurosatory defense exhibition in France, Norinco presented howitzers and other artillery systems that meet NATO standards in a bid to boost exports. Competition between Chinese and Western providers will only intensify in years to come as China tries to boost its exports and expand its global influence. But there are clear limits to what Beijing can offer – its refusal to offer direct alternatives to Western platforms by exporting its more technologically advanced equipment, the limited interoperability with Western systems, and worsening geopolitical competition are likely to hinder China’s efforts. China, however, is also pushing to achieve dominance in advanced technologies with dual-use applications, from autonomous systems to quantum computing, and is leveraging its strategy of civil-military fusion and its access to European and US technologies and know-how to get there. These dual-use technologies and components are increasingly being exported globally. They make up the bulk of China’s military support for Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine. As Chinese firms encounter more obstacles to their sales of conventional weapons systems, it is possible they will shift their focus towards the export of dual-use goods and technologies for military applications – creating a whole new set of challenges for European governments and military industries, and a new arena of competition. , Company profile: Norinco A closer look at an individual Chinese arms manufacturer’s approach to domestic and international sales gives a better sense of how the sector acts on the global stage. Unfortunately, and also typically, there is very little open-source information about Norinco Group (the Northern Industries Group), which is China’s largest arms maker. Norinco Group scores 9/100 on the Transparency International Defense \& Security Transparency Score. As a state-owned enterprise (SOE) overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), and ultimately the State Council, Norinco is not bound by many public reporting requirements. Nor does it have an overseas listing which would open it to scrutiny. These factors limit research into the company’s internal workings and its strategies at home and overseas, but there are significant indicators to extrapolate from. Norinco is China’s largest arms manufacturer, but is only one part of its weapons industryChina’s defense industry is spread across several key state-owned enterprises, though President Xi Jinping’s push for “civil-military fusion” is changing the boundaries between the civilian and defense sectors. The largest players in the sector are:Norinco Group (the Northern Industries Group), which leads the production of land equipment and munitions and its cousin the Southern Industries GroupThe China Electronics Technology Group which makes radar systems, communications equipment, and other electronic platformsThe China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), which builds most of the ships for the PLANThe Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) which makes most of China’s military aircraft and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) which mainly covers China’s space program but also has weapons-making unit.Norinco is a major supplier to the PLA and provides a range of equipment and ordnance to primarily to the PLA’s ground forces, (though it is allegedly the sole arms manufacturer in China which sells to every branch of the military) including: Main battle tanks and light tanksArmored vehiclesMotorized/self-propelled and traditional artilleryMultiple Launch Rocket SystemsMotorized/self-propelled integrated air defense systems Ground and anti-air missiles (these tend to be comparable to handheld systems like Javelins/Stingers, rather than longer range)Cruise missilesRadar systemsUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/drones) Infantry equipment and small armsIn overseas markets, Norinco has defense contracts with some countries as the direct supplier of military equipment, though it does not sell its full range anywhere outside China. Its direct sales focus on types of equipment most in demand from developing countries, where there is less demand for Norinco’s most advanced and powerful products. In these markets, it typically sells the more basic infantry equipment and artillery, lighter armored vehicles and motorized equipment. It also is a sizeable supplier of police, counter-terrorism, and riot control equipment to police forces and paramilitaries. Many developing countries regard Norinco’s product lines favorably based on their specific needs and the low costs. China also overlooks human rights concerns so its deals are less likely to come with strings attached. Norinco also engages in licensing its equipment to international partners rather than exclusively through exports of material made in China.Less than one third of Norinco’s revenue is from weapons, a typical pattern for its Chinese peersAlthough Norinco is China’s largest arms maker, only around 27 percent of its revenue comes from arms sales. At home and abroad, Norinco is involved in other sectors that are either mixed/potentially dual use or civilian business lines. Some are linked to key resources essential for national security like energy and minerals/materials, while other business lines serve to generate revenue and profit to compensate for the low margins and weak profits Norinco receives as a PLA supplier. Many of its overseas business lines are managed through Norinco International Cooperation Ltd. Its overseas interests extend toPetroleum exploitation and trade, including in the Middle East, West Africa, and Latin AmericaMineral exploitation, processing, smelting, and trade in Africa and Latin AmericaEngineering, especially for transportation (mostly rail), energy grid equipment and municipal construction, in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-pacificCivil blasting operations in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and OceaniaCivilian vehicles and heavy equipment in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East Like Norinco, other major Chinese arms manufacturers get only a minor share of their revenue from arms sales. Among China’s top five arms makers, the highest share of revenue derived from arms sales is around 44 percent at China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. At the others, it ranges between 25 percent to 32 percent. By contrast, among the top five US players, the lowest share of revenue derived from arms sales is around 44 percent at Boeing, with the highest share being 90 percent at Lockheed-Martin. European arms makers, likewise, are predominantly dedicated to arms production and adjacent civilian applications.The most probable explanation for these varied business lines is that many of them predate reforms to China’s military and defense systems undertaken by President Xi. At the start of the reform and opening up period in the late 1970s and 1980s, Deng Xiaoping encouraged the PLA and defense-oriented SOEs to get into civilian, commercial businesses. The purpose was twofold – to encourage development wherever possible and to supplement the PLA budget at a time when state resources were focused on economic growth. President Jiang Zemin later pushed back on this in 1999 when he called for PLA divestment (which had a limited effect) and reformed the defense industry by splitting up the major players and making them bid for PLA contracts. The separation of Norinco (Northern Industries Group) and Southern Industries Group dates from this period; the northern company was more successful at winning bids and hence became far larger than the southern one.Military modernization has been a pillar of President Xi’s agenda. In November 2015, he launched a three-year effort to clean up the PLA and force it to divest from the many companies the military used to own and operate. This time, the divestment drive was more thorough and effective. Why, therefore, do Norinco and other Chinese defense industry players still have so many civilian, commercial lines of business after the PLA itself has had to divest? Perhaps because while the PLA itself being a commercial player contributed to corruption and distracted the military from its core functions, there are benefits to Norinco and its peers maintaining commercial business lines. They support the military modernization strategy by bringing in more revenue from varied sources, meaning more capital to invest in R\&D for defense technologies. Norinco’s future is complicated by structural issues at home and geopolitical developments abroadNorinco’s future is rife with challenges and opportunities based in the protected status of China’s arms industry and Beijing’s ability to and appetite for competing with US and European arms makers in third markets. Domestically, China’s arms makers have little competition – the country’s arms industry consists of a small group of SOEs crowding out others. Beijing’s failure to create a robust procurement system and the conditions for real competition to emerge in the sector is both good and bad for Norinco’s future. The firm will benefit from its protected status and guaranteed PLA demand, albeit at low margins. The resulting economies of scale help in seeking more profitable markets abroad. However, lack of competition could stymie innovation and global competitiveness for Norinco and China’s arms sector more generally, given their platforms do not currently offer technological parity with western ones. Norinco and others could become cemented into their current global position – one where they focus on markets under western sanctions, where there is little competition, or markets where cost effectiveness is the primary concern. Compare that with the United States, which has a huge number of arms suppliers. There are some giants, but many of the land systems are drawn from a pool of many players in fierce competition with each other. The situation is similar in the EU and the United Kingdom, where higher numbers of firms exist, even if many of them are smaller players. Norinco’s only real competition for land systems is Southern Industries Group. Both are SOEs that enjoy an implicit guarantee so they need not worry about meaningful competition in China and can take much of their arms business for granted. One issue worth tracking is the trend of civil-military fusion in China. It is a core concept in President Xi’s agenda, the idea being to incorporate more civilian technology leaders into China’s arms industry to improve platform capabilities and possibly create unique advantages for the PLA. In future, this trend may help to compensate for the arms makers’ difficulties in producing technologically-competitive platforms.Finally, Norinco’s global arms sales will be heavily shaped by geopolitical factors beyond its own control. This fact is not unique to Norinco, nor to China’s arms sector – most countries have strict rules governing where and to whom their arms companies can sell which kinds of platforms. Beijing’s negotiations with partner countries will be a key factor in Norinco’s ability to expand its global footprint. Without Beijing’s permission and diplomatic support, Norinco and others would be unable to expand global sales significantly. However, Norinco is making the most of new opportunities globally because its competition from Russian firms has diminished due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On the flip side, Norinco’s ability to expand into many countries is likely to be limited by old and more recent sanctions and other possible measures by the United States, EU, and their partner countries, plus a range of arms control treaties and agreements and more generalized Western pressure on the governments of third market countries. , Global China Inc. Updates Belt and Road Initiative politicsChinese firm starts construction of Serbia’s national football stadiumIn May, PowerChina began construction of the National Football Stadium in Belgrade. The Serbian government has reportedly invested EUR 350 million in the 52 000-seat sports stadium and associated events center, and taken on EUR 190 million in loans to build infrastructure to support the venue.China and Pakistan agree on CPEC ExpansionIn June, during a visit to China by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, both nations agreed to further upgrade the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The talks led to the signing of several key agreements to expand infrastructure, industrial cooperation, and technological exchange. These include the rehabilitation of the Karakoram Highway and improvements to Gwadar Port, as well as the establishment of new growth, livelihood, and innovation corridors.China - Kyrgyzstan - Uzbekistan railway goes aheadThe governments of China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have signed a BRI-related agreement to build a new 523-kilometer railway connecting the three countries, at an estimated cost of USD 8 billion. The agreement signed in Beijing on June 6 covered cooperation on the financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the new railway. Construction is due to start in October.Digital, health, and technologyJV battery plant in Finland gets environmental permitA Chinese-Finnish joint venture, 60 percent-owned by Chinese company CNGR Advanced Material, was granted an environmental and a start-up permit for its battery material plant in February. The EUR 500 million plant is to produce precursor cathode active material (pCAM) used in manufacture of lithium-ion batteries. The project in Hamina, 150 kilometers from Helsinki, drew strong public concern over wastewater and air emissions.Huawei overtakes Samsung as top foldable-phone makerHuawei Technologies overtook Samsung Electronics as the world's leading manufacturer of foldable smartphones in the first quarter of 2024, seizing the top spot for the first time with the popularity its new 5G models. China-based Huawei accounted for 35 percent of foldables shipments in the first quarter, up 21 percentage points on Q1 2023, according to Hong Kong-based Counterpoint research.Energy, resources, and commoditiesHuadian group plans USD 2.4 billion green hydrogen project in VietnamIn March, China’s state-owned power giant Huadian Group unveiled plans to build Vietnam’s largest green hydrogen project, in a joint venture with Vietnamese electricity producer Minh Quang. The USD 2.4 billion plant is projected to produce 60,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year, using around 1 gigawatt (GW) of alkaline and PEM electrolyzers in the process. It is to be powered by 1.2GW of wind power and 800 megawatts (MW) of solar.China’s State Grid signs large power transmission contract in BrazilIn April, China’s State Grid signed a contract to build Brazil’s northeast ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission lines, after winning the bid for the USD 3.6 billion project last year. An estimated 1500 km of new UHV lines will deliver 5 million kilowatts (KW) of power from northeast Brazil, mainly from wind and solar farms, to urban areas in the south. The transmission lines are expected to be operational by 2029.Egypt agrees a joint USD 2 billion Chinese-Korean green hydrogen projectIn March, China’s state-owned CSCEC (China State Construction Engineering Corporation) and Korean firm SK Ecoplant signed an agreement with Egyptian authorities to jointly construct a green hydrogen and ammonia production plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. The USD 2 billion project, scheduled for 2029, aims to generate 778MW of electricity, producing 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen and 250, 000 tonnes of ammonia per year. Chinese lithium firm acquires 100 percent of Mali LithiumIn May, Chinese firm Ganfeng Lithium became sole owner of Mali Lithium with its USD 342 million acquisition of Australia’s Leo Lithium’s 40 percent stake. The Australian firm cited risks associated with Mali’s new mining code as the reason for selling its shares. Mali Lithium holds the license for the Goulamina mine in southern Mali.Trade and financeChinese venture capital and private equity target Middle Eastern investorsChinese venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) companies are increasingly targeting Middle Eastern investors, with over 200 Chinese VC and PE firms visiting the region last year. They have suffered a sharp downturn in fundraising and investment from their traditional backers in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea due to geopolitical tensions — the amount of money raised by Chinese VC and PE firms slumped 18.9 per cent in 2023.Argentina renews USD 5 billion currency swap with ChinaIn June, Argentina’s Central Bank renewed a USD 5 billion tranche of the currency swap it has with its Chinese counterpart, USD 3 billion of which matured in June and the rest in July. The decision means Argentina must start paying the maturities in 2025 and 2026, rather than this year.RetailChinese retailer Miniso shifts focus overseasChinese low-cost retailer Miniso plans to rapidly expand overseas by opening roughly 600 overseas stores this year to shift away from weak domestic markets. It plans to open only around 400 stores in China this year.Transport and logisticsCambodia breaks ground on China-funded USD 1.7 billion canalIn August, Cambodia broke ground on a controversial, China-funded canal from the capital, Phnom Penh, to the sea, despite environmental concerns and the risk of strained relations with neighboring Vietnam. The USD 1.7 billion, 180-kilometer canal will connect the capital with coastal Kep province, giving access to the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia hopes the 100-meter wide, 5.4-meter deep canal will lower the cost of shipping goods to its sole deep-sea port, Sihanoukville, and reduce reliance on Vietnamese ports. CSSC to build USD 6 billion worth of LNG vessels for QatarIn April, state-owned oil and gas company Qatar Energy signed a USD 6 billion contract with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for 18 liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels. The ships will be the largest of their kind in the world, at 344 meters long, with a capacity of 271 000 cubic meters. They will be built at China’s Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard for delivery between 2028 and 2031.CRSC to supply signaling systems for iron mine railway in GuineaIn April, Chinese railway signal manufacturer CRSC won a contract to supply systems to a major railway project in Guinea. The 552-kilometer railway connects Maribaya port with the Simandou iron mine, the world’s largest known iron ore reserve. The deal, worth RMB 1.2 billion, is CRSC’s largest overseas contract to date.Laos Thailand cross-border railway passenger train starts operationsThe Chinese-built cross-border railway passenger service between Laos and Thailand officially went into operation on July 19. The first train traveled between the two countries’ capital cities in approximately 12 hours. The new rail service will enhance regional connectivity and economic integration. , Endnotes1 SIPRI’s trend-indicator value (TIV) is a system designed to measure the volume of international transfers of major conventional weapons using a common unit that allows for the measurement of trends in the flow of arms to particular countries and regions over time. The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

	abstract = {Imports of major arms by states in Europe increased by 94 per cent between 2014–18 and 2019–23, while the global volume of international arms transfers decreased marginally, by 3.3 per cent. There were overall decreases in arms transfers to all other regions, but states in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East continued to import arms in much larger volumes than those in Europe. Nine of the 10 biggest arms importers in 2019–23, including the top 3 of India, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, were in Asia and Oceania or the Middle East. Ukraine became the fourth biggest arms importer globally after it received transfers of major arms from over 30 states in 2022–23.},
