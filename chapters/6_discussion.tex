\lettrine{W}{hat came to light in the preceding chapter} needs some context and explanation. The theories developed against the backdrop of pre-existing research was wrong in regards to China's impact on its partners, and we need to understand why this is the case. Is this a limited area where the theory does not fit, or does this extend to autocratic diffusion theory in general?

I start this chapter with a discussion on how the findings of the analysis might give an answer to my research question, which is: \textit{can major powers affect freedom of expression in other countries?} I have no clear answer, but the most likely one based on this study is: possibly, but probably not. This is not a clear answer, but there are unfortunately too many variables in play to be able to say anything for certain. This should be the main takeaway from this study, however, I will now discuss this in greater depth.
