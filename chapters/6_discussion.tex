I start this chapter with a discussion on how the findings of the analysis might give an answer to my research question, which is: \textit{can major powers affect freedom of expression in other countries?} I have no clear answer, but the most likely one based on this study is: possibly, but probably not. This is not a clear answer, but there are unfortunately too many variables in play to be able to say anything for certain. This should be the main takeaway from this study, however, I will now discuss this in greater depth.
