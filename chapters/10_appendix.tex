\lettrine{T}{his part of the appendix} includes some notes on the figures, as well as some descriptive data which was unnecessary to include in the main part of the thesis. I include this appendix so that everything I have done is reproducible.

\section{Figures}
Here follows some notes on the figures.

\subsection{Figure \ref{fig:link-china}}
For this figure I have made some important decisions that impact some of the results if done to other specifications. The first problem I had, was that some of the countries did not have numbers for 1994. This problem mainly occurs as an artifact of countries splitting up. There are four major countries affected by this: Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and South Sudan. To include them, I decided to use their pre-independence counterpart as the 1994 value. This probably makes the values for 1994 artificially high, leading them to getting a lower score than would else have been the case. This is highly likely in the case of Serbia. The second thing to note is the definition of the size of the changes. I have arbitrarily defined them, based on what is normal in the same data. I have made the following distinctions: Higher than 0.2 change in linkages equals a very strong change. Change between 0.2 and 0.08 i define as a strong change. Change between 0.08 and 0.03 I define a change, and everything between 0 and 0.03 I define as no or small change.
