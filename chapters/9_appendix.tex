\lettrine{T}{his appendix chapter} includes some additional information about the models I have run. I include this to discuss some of the notable features and challenges to the models, and how I account for this.

\section{Residuals}
I here display the residual plot of Model 2.5 in Table \ref{tab:h2}. The residuals are quite similarly distributed in all the main plots. We can see a very distinct shape to the plot, but there are two important ting to note, ant that is: one, the model is unbiased, and two, this problem of heteroscedasticity can be solved by using clustered standard errors.
